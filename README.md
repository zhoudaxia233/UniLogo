# UniLogo

**UniLogo** assembles the logos of the top 1000 universities according to the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU). The unique feature of this project is the color-based sorting of logos into a spectrum, presented in two formats: **grid** and **dense paving**.  


Below is a sample of the densely paved logos (*with 300 universities*):
<figure>
<img src="./images/300-logos.png" alt="Densely paved logos" style="width:95%" />

Below is the densely paved logos for **top 300** universities by ranking:

<img src="./images/top300.png" alt="Densely paved logos" style="width:95%" />
</figure>

Below is logos in 25*25 grid, if universities share same coordinate, only the university with the best rank is shown.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Consider the proportion of the dominant color in the logo during sorting.
- [ ] Geometric clustering
