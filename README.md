# UniLogo

**UniLogo** assembles the logos of the top 1000 universities according to the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU). The unique feature of this project is the color-based sorting of logos into a spectrum, presented in two formats: **grid** and **dense paving**.  


Below is a sample of the densely paved logos (*with 300 universities*):
